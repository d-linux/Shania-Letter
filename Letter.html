                        <p>Dear Shania,</p>
                        
                        <p>From the very first moment I met you,<br>
                        I felt something I couldn't explain <br>
                        a warmth, a pull, a quiet spark<br>
                        that felt both comforting and terrifying.<br>
                        There was a connection between us<br>
                        that shook the walls I'd built around my heart.<br>
                        I tried to protect myself,<br>
                        but the truth is, the more I tried to resist,<br>
                        the deeper I fell in love with you.<br>
                        And by the time I realised it,<br>
                        it was already too late <br>
                        my heart was completely yours.</p>

                        <p>I can't recall a single day<br>
                        when you haven't made me feel loved.<br>
                        Even in our storms <br>
                        in the disagreements, the silence, the tears <br>
                        you've always found a way<br>
                        to remind me of your love.<br>
                        You've loved me with a patience,<br>
                        a tenderness,<br>
                        that I never thought I deserved.</p>

                        <p>God truly blessed me with you.<br>
                        Your presence in my life<br>
                        is proof that He listens,<br>
                        that He knows exactly what my soul needs.<br>
                        You've shown me that life is still beautiful,<br>
                        that love can be gentle and strong<br>
                        all at once.</p>

                        <p>When I think of you,<br>
                        I'm filled with a joy so pure<br>
                        it feels like sunlight in my chest.<br>
                        Sometimes I wonder how someone like you<br>
                        could ever love someone like me <br>
                        but then I see how our hearts fit together,<br>
                        how our differences make us stronger,<br>
                        and I know we were meant to be.</p>

                        <p>You are my answered prayer,<br>
                        my peace, my home.<br>
                        Without you, life would be a restless dream,<br>
                        but with you,<br>
                        I'm living the kind of dream<br>
                        I never want to wake from.</p>
